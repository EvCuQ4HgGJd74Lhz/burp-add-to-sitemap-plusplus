# Add to sitemap++ 
Add to sitemap++ is a [BURP](https://portswigger.net/burp) extension that can read URLs from files or clipboard and add the discovered information on the site map of the selected host(s).

Information doesnâ€™t need to be structured, only readable strings. Regular expressions will handle the information.

Extension can handle many kinds of files but must be in URL structure (example _https://www.example.com/_), tested files are:
- plaintext files
- xml files
- zip files (containing text files) 
- docx, xlsx, pptx
- Vulnerability scanner files from the Nessus, Acunetix, Dirb and Nikto (with htm output) maybe more only tested on these ðŸ˜Š

Install Extension:
```
Burp Suite > Extender > Extensions > Add > Extension type: Python > Extension file: Add_Sitemap++.py > Next
```
>Credits for [Nixawk's script](https://github.com/nixawk/hello-python2/blob/master/burpsuite/sitemap-Import_links.py) helped me a lot. But I needed more files and clipboard with regex to be supported. Regex found on internet multiple locations (credits for the founder) canâ€™t find it anymore, but you can try on https://regex101.com/r/pNc2cC/1 and fixed freely ðŸ˜Š.
